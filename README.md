# BinarySearch
BinarySearch Algorithm written in different languages.

BinarySearch Algorithms are a common aspect of software developer interview process. Since I don't implement this algorithm regularly in my day job, I wanted to practice this algorithm in different languages. This could be used as a study aid for those interested. 

I will implement both a recursive version and non-recursive version of the algorithm.
